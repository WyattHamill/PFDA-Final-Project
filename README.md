## Description
As a digital artist I have used media encoding and converting websites thousands of times. Many of these sites aren't the safest to use and can risk downloading malicious content. This program is intended to do similar tasks, encoding video files and converting images.

Pycoder is a lightweight media encoding and conversion tool written in Python. This program will allow you to:

- Convert PNG, EXR, and JPG image sequences in MP4
- Convert single images between PNG, EXR, and JPG
- Convert entire image sequences from one format to another
- Encode PNG and EXR image sequences as MP4 files
