## Description
As a digital artist I have used media encoding and converting websites thousands of times. Many of these sites aren't the safest to use and can risk downloading malicious content. This program is intended to do similar tasks, encoding video files and converting images.

## Features
- PNG Sequence to MP4
	- Takes folder with PNG sequence and converts it into a MP4
- EXR Sequence to MP4
	- Takes folder with EXR sequence and converts it into a MP4
- PNG Sequence to GIF
	- Takes folder with PNG sequence and converts it into a GIF
- EXR Sequence to GIF
    - Takes folder with EXR sequence and converts it into a GIF
- Convert between PNG, JPG, and EXR
    - Convert images between PNG, JPG, and EXR formats
- Reduce image size
    - Takes PNG, JPG, or EXR images and reduces image size of the file
- UI Elements for all features
    - UI Screen, with button to choose the folder, choose what operation to do, and rename the output

## Minimum Viable Product
- PNG Sequence to MP4
- PNG Sequence to GIF
- UI Elements

## Challenges
- UI will be a big challenge. I will need to implement ways to open file navigation and choose files.
- I will need to figure out how to type on pygame screen to rename the file output

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideal outcome is to have a working visual program that can encode MP4 and GIF, convert image files, and reduce image file size

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Minimal outcome is to have a terminal program that can encode PNG sequences to MP4 and convert between PNG, JPG, and EXR
